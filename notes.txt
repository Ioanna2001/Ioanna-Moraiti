How to upload a website to the internet:
	>Server
	>Ci/CD (continious integration continious delivery): We push the contents of our repo to a server (git provides a server, a git page). 
	 When we type the link the automatic respnse is to go to the index page. Settings>Pages>branch:main>/root>save
*if we want to create hierarcchy in our body element we can use nav (more than one) with the first one being th emost imoortant and ul
*.classname>ul: The direct ul child of class classname
*.classname ul: all the unsorted lists not just the direct child

Animation: 
	>@ in css declares a condition
	@keyframes:
	>then you add animatio-.. attributes to css elements
*relative postition: the child is positioned according to the mother frame
*absolute position: the element is positioned according to the highest relative element
<picture>: we specify different sources for different widths etc.
<video>: works the same way as picture, with mp4, ogg(chrome etc.)
<audio>: works the same way
*z-index: what element goes on top and what video goes on the bottom (from -1...)
*pointer-events: set it so the mouse can touch it or not
